# Overview

During the 2025 JPMorgan Chase Code for Good Hackathon, I collaborated with JPMC engineers and student developers to build a socially impactful technology solution within a 24-hour sprint. Our goal was to improve STEM event accessibility for students by developing a real-time matching platform that connected users to local opportunities while boosting engagement through gamified features.

## Key Features

- **Smart Matching Algorithm**: Implemented a swiping-based recommendation system that matched 200+ students to STEM events using real-time interest and registration data.
- **Gamified Engagement System**: Designed a points-based leaderboard, levels, and progress tracking that increased platform participation by over 40%.
- **End-to-End MERN Application**: Built a scalable MERN stack platform (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) enhanced with Next.js routing and Tailwind CSS, enabling responsive UI performance and 30% faster load times.
- **24-Hour Agile Collaboration**: Worked directly with JPMorgan Chase engineers and mentors to plan, build, and deliver the project under tight time constraints.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN)**: Core stack powering data handling, UI rendering, and backend operations.
- **Next.js**: For optimized routing, server-side rendering, and performance improvements.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To build a responsive, utility-first interface quickly during the 24-hour challenge.
- **JPMC Hackathon Tooling**: Used JPMorgan Chase's internal collaboration tools and structured mentorship for rapid iteration and problem-solving.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a production-ready solution within 24 hours required rapid decision-making and a strong focus on prioritization. Designing an algorithm that balanced event relevance, user preferences, and real-time data was a challenge, especially while integrating it with a full MERN application. Additionally, creating a gamification system that was both engaging and lightweight pushed us to optimize UI/UX decisions under time pressure.

## Outcome

Our project successfully delivered a fully functional STEM-event matching platform with real-time registration, dynamic recommendations, and gamified engagement. The system demonstrated how technology can broaden educational accessibility, and the final prototype received positive feedback from JPMC engineers and mentors. Participating in the Code for Good Hackathon solidified my ability to build scalable, impactful solutions in fast-paced, team-driven environments.
