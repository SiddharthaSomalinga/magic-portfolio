# Overview

In this project, I developed an automated cybersecurity intelligence monitoring system designed to track emerging threats across online forums and surface high-signal insights in real time. The goal was to enhance threat visibility for Microsoft 365 users by detecting discussions related to attacks such as token theft and business email compromise (BEC).

## Key Features

- **Automated Intelligence Collection**: Built a Python-based pipeline that continuously monitored online forums for cybersecurity discussions, increasing threat coverage by over 60%.
- **AI-Driven Threat Filtering**: Applied machine learning models to identify and prioritize relevant cyber threats, reducing noise and improving real-time alert quality.
- **Real-Time Alerting**: Implemented a responsive alerting mechanism that helped Microsoft 365 clients act quickly and accurately on potential cybersecurity attacks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for automation, data collection, and threat parsing.
- **Machine Learning/AI Models**: Used to classify, rank, and filter threat-related content.
- **Web Scraping Libraries**: For gathering cybersecurity discussions across online communities.
- **Microsoft 365 Ecosystem**: Integrated findings to support threat awareness for users and administrators.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was filtering large amounts of unstructured forum data while maintaining high precision. Developing AI models that could distinguish between general discussion and actionable threat intelligence was essential for reducing alert fatigue. Additionally, real-time responsiveness required optimizing the pipeline to handle rapid updates and varied data quality.

## Outcome

The system increased monitoring coverage by 60% and improved alert relevance and responsiveness by 40%, enabling Microsoft 365 users to react more quickly to emerging threats such as token theft and business email compromise. This project demonstrated the value of combining automation and AI to enhance cybersecurity intelligence workflows.
